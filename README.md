# Computer Vission

This repository contains the code of the various methods that we attempted for the Data Science Bowl 2018 challenge run by Kaggle.

## Getting Started

Each subfolder contains code specific to that method as presented in class:

* Analytical Methods
* Edge Classification
* Mask RCNN
* U-Net

We also included our E-Net code, even though we weren't able to get it fully working by submission time.

### Prerequisites

We use the following libraries and systems:

* Python 3
* Tensorflow
* Jupyter
* CUDA
* OpenCV 3
