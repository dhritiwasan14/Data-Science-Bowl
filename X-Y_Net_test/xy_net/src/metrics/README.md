# Statistical Measurements

## Description

In this directory, the script `stats_utils.py` contains the code for each statistical measure. In order of appearance, the available measurementsare:

- get_fast_aji()
- get_fast_dice_2()
- get_fast_panoptic_quality()
- get_dice_1()
- get_dice_2()
- get_aji()

`get_aji()`: aggregated jaccard index as used in **[1]**. Ported from the authors' matlab code. The original matlab code is also given in the directory. <br/>
`get_fast_aji()`: aji optimised for speed. Set `mode=plus` to run AJI+, as used within our paper. <br/>
`get_dice_1()` and `get_dice_2()`: standard dice and ensemble dice (DICE2) **[2]** measures respectively. <br/> `get_fast_panoptic_quality()`: panoptic quality as used in **[3]**.
